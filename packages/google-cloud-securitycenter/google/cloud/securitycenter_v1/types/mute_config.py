class MuteConfig(proto.Message):
    r"""A mute config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the
    configuration to mute create/update events of findings.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            This field will be ignored if provided on config creation.
            Format
            ``organizations/{organization}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
            ``folders/{folder}/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``

            ``projects/{project}/locations/global/muteConfigs/{mute_config}``
        display_name (str):
            The human readable name to be displayed for
            the mute config.
        description (str):
            A description of the mute config.
        filter (str):
            Required. An expression that defines the filter to apply
            across create/update events of findings. While creating a
            filter string, be mindful of the scope in which the mute
            configuration is being created. E.g., If a filter contains
            project = X but is created under the project = Y scope, it
            might not match any findings.

            The following field and operator combinations are supported:

            -  severity: ``=``, ``:``
            -  category: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.project_name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.project_display_name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.folders.resource_folder: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.parent_name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.parent_display_name: ``=``, ``:``
            -  resource.type: ``=``, ``:``
            -  finding_class: ``=``, ``:``
            -  indicator.ip_addresses: ``=``, ``:``
            -  indicator.domains: ``=``, ``:``
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the mute
            config was created. This field is set by the
            server and will be ignored if provided on config
            creation.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The most recent time at which
            the mute config was updated. This field is set
            by the server and will be ignored if provided on
            config creation or update.
        most_recent_editor (str):
            Output only. Email address of the user who
            last edited the mute config. This field is set
            by the server and will be ignored if provided on
            config creation or update.
        type_ (google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.MuteConfig.MuteConfigType):
            Optional. The type of the mute config, which
            determines what type of mute state the config
            affects. The static mute state takes precedence
            over the dynamic mute state. Immutable after
            creation. STATIC by default if not set during
            creation.
        expiry_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Optional. The expiry of the mute config. Only
            applicable for dynamic configs. If the expiry is
            set, when the config expires, it is removed from
            all findings.

                Unused.
            STATIC (1):
                A static mute config, which sets the static
                mute state of future matching findings to muted.
                Once the static mute state has been set, finding
                or config modifications will not affect the

                A dynamic mute config, which is applied to
                existing and future matching findings, setting
                their dynamic mute state to "muted". If the
                config is updated or deleted, or a matching
                finding is updated, such that the finding
                doesn't match the config, the config will be
                removed from the finding, and the finding's
                dynamic mute state may become "unmuted" (unless
                other configs still match).
